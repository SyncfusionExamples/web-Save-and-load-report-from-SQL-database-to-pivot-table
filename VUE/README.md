# How to save and load reports from a SQL Server Database to a Pivot Table

A quick start project that shows how to save and load reports from a SQL Server database and load them into the Syncfusion Pivot Table at run time. This repository includes a ASP.NET Core Web App Controller ([MyWebService](../MyWebService/)) for saving and loading reports from a SQL server database, as well as a quick start samples in the Vue platform that displays the loaded report in a Syncfusion Pivot Table.

## Project prerequisites

Before beginning work on the server and client projects, ensure the following software to be installed in the machine.

* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/ ) and [.NET Core SDK 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) or later installed on your machine.

## How to run this application?

* To run this application, clone the [Save-and-load-report-from-SQL-database-to-pivot-table](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/Save-and-load-report-from-SQL-database-to-pivot-table) repository and then open **MyWebService** in Visual Studio 2022. Simply build and run your project in IIS Express, and it will host and display the URL `https://localhost:44313`.

* Now open Vue sample in Visual Studio Code and and install the necessary npm packages using the following command.

```sh
